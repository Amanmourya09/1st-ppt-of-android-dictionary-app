#### ✅ Slide 1: Introduction

Hello everyone,

My name is **Aman Mourya**, and I have completed my **Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech)** from **Uttaranchal University**.

Today, I’m going to present a mobile application that I’ve developed called the **"Ayurvedic Dictionary"** — an app designed to help students, practitioners, and even common people understand **Ayurvedic medical terminology** more easily.

This project is a combination of **technology and tradition** — where modern app development meets ancient Indian knowledge of Ayurveda.

---

#### ❓ Slide 2: Why Did I Build This App?

During my studies and research into Ayurveda, I noticed that many students and even professionals face a major issue:

> **“Ayurvedic terms are complex, scattered, and hard to find in one place.”**

Also, most of the content is written in **Sanskrit or old Hindi**, which makes it difficult for new learners or the general public to understand.

So, I asked myself:

> “Can I make this knowledge more accessible using technology?”

That’s how the idea of the **Ayurvedic Dictionary App** was born.

---

#### 🔧 Slide 3: What Problem Does It Solve?

The main problems I wanted to solve were:

1. **Lack of a centralized database** for Ayurvedic terms.
2. Difficulty in **searching and understanding Sanskrit words**.
3. No easy way to **pronounce or bookmark** important terms.
4. Lack of a **user-friendly mobile interface** for Ayurvedic learning.

With this app, I tried to provide a simple yet powerful solution.

---

#### 🧠 Slide 4: What is the Ayurvedic Dictionary App?

The **Ayurvedic Dictionary App** is a mobile application built using **React Native and Expo SDK 53**.

It allows users to search for **Ayurvedic terms in Hindi**, get their **Sanskrit meanings**, and also access additional information like gender, description, and book references.

It acts as a **bridge between traditional Ayurvedic wisdom and modern digital tools**.

---

#### 🚀 Slide 5: Key Features

Let me quickly walk you through the key features of the app:

- 🔍 **Search in Hindi**: Easily find Ayurvedic terms using Hindi keywords.
- 🔎 **Smart Filters**: Refine your search by word, gender, book reference, etc.

- 💾 **Local Storage**: Uses **AsyncStorage** to save favorites and history.
- ☁️ **Cloud Sync Ready**: Data can be fetched from a server using **Axios API**.
- 📱 **Clean UI**: Simple and user-friendly design with clear navigation.

---

#### 💻 Slide 6: Technology Stack

Here’s what I used to build the app:

- **React Native** – For building cross-platform mobile apps
